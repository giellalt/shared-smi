# shared-smi: Shared S치mi lexical resources

This repository contains shared linguistic resource usable for GiellaLT infra,
that are from S치mi languages:

* Proper nouns (with S치mi specific paradigm lexicon coding)

This repo is optional but recommended data for building most of the S치mi
languages in `giellalt/langs-{sma,sme,smj,sms,sjd}` set and can be used for
others just as well.

This repo was split off from `giellalt/giella-shared/smi` with commit histoy
intact where available. Some conversion quirks may have lost some bits...
